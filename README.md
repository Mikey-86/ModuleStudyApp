A WPF application that asks users for their module information (name, dates, credits, etc.) and then calculates how much time is needed for studying each week.
This project was done in my second year, second semester for my programming class.

The program has a database that is connected to the application through ADO.NET disconnected layer. User details and module details are stored here. Students details are hashed to protect them on the database. 
The main screen has a login functionality that compares entered data against stored data and sends the user to their account.  
Additional business rules include: using LINQ for queries and utilising a class library.
